## 🏃‍♂️ How to Run the Programs

You can run the `.c` files using:

### 🔧 **GCC via Terminal**
```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

### 💻 **Or Use an IDE**
Use any C IDE like `Code::Blocks`, `Dev C++`, `VS Code` with C extensions, etc.

> 📌 Tip: For beginners, [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) is a great choice with minimal setup.
